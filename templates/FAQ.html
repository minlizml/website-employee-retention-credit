                    <p>
                        The Employee Retention Tax Credit is a government tax credit created by the Coronavirus Aid, 
                        Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Employee Retention Credit allows small and medium
                        business owners to receive a tax break for employees they were able to keep on staff during the
                        Coronavirus pandemic.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        More specifically, employers eligible for the Employee Retention Credit can receive up to 50% of 
                        wages paid to their employees between the dates of March 13th 2020 and December 31st 2020 with a 
                        limit of $10,000 per employee.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        The ERC was extended by the Relief Act of 2021 to 70% of an employee’s wages per calendar quarter
                        per employee from January 1st 2021 until October 1st 2021, with a limit of $10,000 per employee per quarter.

                    <p>
                        To qualify for the Employee Retention Credit, your business must fall into one of the following categories:<br>
                        <br/>
                        1). <strong>A disruption in business operations</strong> beginning after February 15, 2020 and continued due to the coronavirus
                        pandemic. This includes businesses that are fully or partially suspended by government orders or are unable 
                        to operate at normal capacity due to the pandemic.or
                        <br/>
                        <br/>    
                        2).<strong>A revenue decline.</strong> Your eligibility is largely based on your 2019 records. First, your business must have 
                        500 or fewer employees in 2019 to qualify. Also, your company's quarterly gross receipts in 2020 and 2021 
                        must be at least 20% lower than the corresponding quarter in 2019. This is to prove your company was financially
                        impacted by the Coronavirus lockdown.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        On top of that, you must be a private sector or tax-exempt company that dealt with a partial or full shutdown of 
                        operations due to COVID-19.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        You do not need a revenue decline to qualify, in fact, many businesses had a revenue increase and still qualified
                        that experienced a disruption in business operations.

                    <p>
                        Qualified wages include the Eligible Employer's qualified health plan expenses
                        that are properly allocable to the wages.
                        <br/>

                        The specific circumstances in which wage payments by an Eligible Employer will
                        be considered qualified wages depend, in part, on the average number of full-time 
                        employees it employed during 2019. For an Eligible Employer that averaged more than
                        100 full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to an employee
                        for time that the employee is not providing services due to either
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        (1) a full or partial suspension of the employer's business operations by a governmental order, or<br>
                        (2) the business experiencing a significant decline in gross receipts. For an Eligible Employer that
                        averaged 100 or fewer full-time employees in 2019, qualified wages are the wages paid to any employee
                        during any period in the calendar quarter in which the business operations are fully or partially
                        suspended due to a governmental order or any calendar quarter the business is experiencing a significant
                        decline in gross receipts.

                    <p>
                        According to the IRS, you can expect reimbursement between <strong>six and ten months</strong> after you filed your 941-X form. 
                        However, current filers report that reimbursement can be as soon as ONE month with an average of three to five in 2022.

                        Yes, you can qualify for the Employee Retention Program (ERC) even if you've already received a Small 
                        Business Interruption Loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). It is also possible to only benefit 
                        from one or the other, and not receiving a PPP loan will not impact your ability to receive the ERC tax credit. 
                        SnackNation even outlines the differences in their guide to ERC vs PPP.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                       
                        However, the credits from the Employee Retention Program can only be used on wages that were not forgiven by the 
                        PPP—if the PPP already covered it, they are not eligible for the tax credit.

                    <p>
                        The ERC is not taxable income. You won't need to pay any of your tax credit back once it is received, assuming you 
                        follow all the rules and regulations.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                       
                        However, the ERC will impact your income tax return. Any employer tax credits will result in a reduction in wages that 
                        matches the amount of the credit. The impact of this credit needs to be reflected in the year it was received. So, if 
                        the reduction was for 2021, your 2021 tax return must reflect these post-credit wages.

                <label for="question7" class="accordion_label">Will ERC be extended?</label>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, it does not seem likely that the employee retention credit will be extended. The ERC was already extended 
                        twice, once by the Relief Act of 2021 and again by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021
                        <br/>
                        <br/>                       
                        With the passing of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) in November of 2021, the ERC retroactively ended on 
                        October 1st of 2021. While you can still claim the tax credit you're eligible for from<strong>January 1st 2020 through 
                        October 1st 2021, </strong> it is unlikely there'll be future financial quarters where the ERC is offered.
